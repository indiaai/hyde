  Hey there! Welcome to the IndiaAI initiative. Check out our upcoming meeting, join us and contribute.
</p>

IndiaAI is an open community initiative here to propelling the advancement and adoption of AI with special focus but not limited to Deep Learning and its derivatives. 

Building great AI tools for tomorrow using today's technology requires *entrepreneurs, developers, students, academicians, research scientists, investors, and just about anyone who is interested in Deep Learning* to come together as a community to meet, share and hack. The IndiaAI initiative will serve to enable this purpose.

* [Deep Learning Bangalore (DLBLR)](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Bangalore/)
* [Deep Learning Bombay (DLBOM)](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Mumbai/)

* [Deep Learning Delhi (DLDEL)](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Delhi/)
* [Deep Learning Hyderabad (DLHYD)](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Hyderabad/)

We have a culture code. #LikeNoOther #AdvanceAI #AmazingCommunity
